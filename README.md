# About

This repo was original going to be about Dionysus Thrax's _Art of Grammar_, but ended up becoming a repo for other grammatical writings as well that I wanted to read with Alpheios support. 


# Grammatical writings by Apollonius Dyscolus

The original files for the four extant works are taken from [Andreas Schmidhauser's website](https://schmidhauser.us/apollonius/works/) which states that "The first three treatises have been edited by Richard Schneider; the Syntax is due to Gustav Uhlig." (both of which are dated to 1910). I assume Schmidhauser did the digitization.

* Περὶ ἀντωνυμίαϲ
* Περὶ сυνδέсμων
* Περὶ ἐπιρρημάτων
* Περὶ сυντάξεωс

_Περὶ сυντάξεωс_ is available [here](dyscolus_synt.html) with Alpheios added. Note that I don't really understand the format of the source files so the paragraph breaks are my addition to make it manageable on screen.

Due to the age of the original works and the lack of a copyright statement on the source page, I'm assuming they are public domain and doing my best to give credit to those who have produced them.

# Thrax_grammar
 
 There are two versions Dionysus Thrax's _Art of Grammar_. One that is the Greek text with Alpheios and the other that includes the English translation with the sentences aligned (more of less) in addition to Alpheios.
