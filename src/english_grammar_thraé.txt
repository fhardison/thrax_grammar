 An Adverb is an indeclinable part of speech, said of a verb or added to a verb. Of the Adverbs, some are Simple, and others Compound—Simple, as πάλαι; Compound, as πρόπαλαι. Some are indicative of time, as νῦν, τότε, αὖθις: to these we must subordinate as species those that connote particular times or seasons, as σήμερον, αὔριον, τόφρα, τέως, πηνίκα.
Some indicate manner, as καλῶς, σοφῶς, δυνατῶς; some, quality, as πύξ, λάξ, βοτρυδόν, ἀγεληδόν; some, quantity, as πολλάκις, ὀλιγάκις, μυριάκις; some, number, as δίς, τρίς, τετράκις; some, place, as ἄνω, κάτω—of these there are three kinds, those signifying /in/ a place, those signifying /to/ a place, and those signifying /from/ a place, as οἴκοι, οἴκαδε, οἴκοθεν.

 # On Conjunctions (σύνδεσμος). 
 A Conjunction is a word binding together a thought in order and filling up the hiatuses of speech. Of conjunctions, some are copulative, some disjunctive, some conjunctive, some præter-conjunctive, some causative, some dubitative, some conclusive, and some expletive. /Copulative/ Conjunctions are those which bind together a discourse which flows on indefinitely: they are these, μέν, δέ, τέ, καί, ἀλλά, ἠμέν, ἠδέ, ἀτάρ, αὐτάρ, ἤτοι. /Disjunctive/ Conjunctions are those which bind the phrase more firmly together, and disjoin the facts expressed: they are these, ἤ, ἤτοι, ἠέ. /Conjunctive/ Conjunctions are those which do not indicate any actual existence, but signify sequence: they are these, εἰ, εἴπερ, εἰδή, εἰδήπερ. The /Præter-conjunctives/ are those which, along with actual existence, show also order: they are these, ἐπεί, ἐπείπερ, ἐπειδή, ἐπειδήπερ . /Causatives/ are those which are taken to express cause: they are these, ἵνα , ὄφρα , ὅπως , ἕνεκα , οὕνεκα , ὅτι , διό , διότι , καθό , καθότι , καθόσον . /Dubitatives/ are those which we are wont to use when we are in doubt; they are these, ἆρα , κἆτα , μῶν . /Inferentials/ are those which lend themselves readily to conclusions and summings-up of demonstrations: they are these, ἄρα , ἀλλά , ἀλλὰ μέν , τοίνυν , τοιγάρτοι , τοιγαροῦν. /Expletives/ are those which are used for the sake of metre or ornament: they are these, δή , ῥά , νύ , ποῦ , τοί , θήν , ἄρ , δῆτα , πέρ , πώ , μήν , ἄν , αὖ , οὖν , κέν , γέ . Some persons add also /Adversatives/, as ἔμπης , ὅμως .
