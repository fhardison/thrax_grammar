 # On the Word (λέξις).
 A Word is the smallest part of an ordered sentence. 
 
 # On the Sentence (λόγος).
 
A Sentence is combination of words, either in prose or in verse, making complete sense. There are eight parts of speech: Noun, Verb, Participle, Article, Pronoun, Preposition, Adverb, and Conjunction. The proper noun, as a species, is subordinate to the noun. 

 # On the Noun (ὄνομα).
A Noun is a declinable part of speech, signifying something either concrete or abstract (concrete, as stone; abstract, as education); common or proper (common, as man, horse; proper, as Socrates, Plato).  It has five accidents: genders, species, forms, numbers, and cases.
 There are three /Genders/, the masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.
Some add to these two more, the common and the epicene—common, as man, horse; epicene, as swallow, eagle.
There are two /Species/ of nouns, the primitive and the derivative. A primitive noun is one which is said according to original imposition, as γῆ (earth); a derivative noun is one which derives its origin from another noun, as γαιήιος (earthborn). There are seven classes of derivatives: Patronymics, Possessives, Comparatives, Diminutives, Nominals, Superlatives, and Verbals. A /Patronymic/ is properly a noun formed from the name of a father, improperly a noun formed from the name of another ancestor, e.g., Achilleus is called both Peleides and Aiakides. Of masculine patronymics there are three forms, one in δης, one in ων and one in άδιος—e.g. Atreion, Atreides, and the form peculiar to the Æolians, Hyrradios. (Pittakos was the son of Hyrras.) Of feminine patronymics there are likewise three forms, one in ις, as Priamis; one in ας, as Pelias; one in νη, as Adrastinê. From the names of mothers, Homer forms no species of patronymics; later authors do. A /Possessive/ is a noun which denotes possession and includes the possessor, as Νηλήιαι ἵπποι (Neleian mares), Ἑκτόρεος χιτών (Hektorean robe), Πλατωνικὸν βιβλίον (Platonic book). A /Comparative/ is a noun making a comparison of one individual with another individual of the same genus, e.g. Achilleus /braver/ than Aias; or of one individual with many of a different genus, e.g. Achilleus /braver/ than the Trojans. Of comparatives there are three forms, one in τερος, as ὀξύτερος, βραδύτερος; one in ων pure, as βελτίων, καλλίων; one in σων, as κρείσσων, ἦσσων. A /Superlative/ is a noun used to express the superiority, of one individual over many in a comparison. There are two forms of it, one in τατος, as ὀξύτατος, βραδύτατος; and one in στος, as μέγιστος, ἄριστος. A /Diminutive/ is a noun expressing a diminution of the primitive word without comparison, as ἀνθρωπίσκος (mannikin), λίθαξ (stonelet), μειρακύλλιον (stripling). A /Nominal/ is a word formed alongside a noun, or as from a noun, as Theon, Tryphon. A /Verbal/ is a noun derived from a verb, as Philemon, Noëmon.
 There are three /Forms/ of nouns, simple, compound, and super-compound—simple, as Memnon; compound, as Agamemnon; super-compound, as Agamemnonides, Philippides. Of compounds there are four kinds; 1°. those compounded of two complete words, as Cheirisophos; 2°. those compounded of two incomplete words, as Sophokles; 3°. those compounded of an incomplete and a complete word, as Philodemos; and 4°.
those compounded of a complete word and an incomplete, as Periklês.
 There are three /Numbers/, singular, dual, and plural; singular, as Ὅμηρος (Homer); dual, as τὼ Ὁμήρω (both Homers); plural, as Ὅμηροι (Homers). There are some singular designations used of plural objects, as δῆμος (people), χορός (chorus); and plural designations used of singular and dual objects—of singular, as Ἀθῆναι , Θῆβαι  (Athens, Thebes)—of dual, as ἀμφότεροι  (both).
 There are five /Cases/, the right, the generic,  the dative, the accusative, and the vocative. The right case is called also the nominative and the direct; the generic, the possessive, and the patrial; the dative, the injunctive; while the accusative is named from /cause/, and the vocative is called the allocutive.
 The following terms, expressive of accidents belonging to the noun, are also called /Species:/ proper, appellative, adjective, relative, quasi-relative, homonym, synonym, pheronym, dionym, eponym, national, interrogative, indefinite, anaphoric (also called assimilative, demonstrative, and retributive), collective, distributive, inclusive, onomatopoetic, general, special, ordinal, numeral, participative, independent.
 A /Proper/ noun is one signifying a peculiar substance,  as Homer, Sokrates. An /Appellative/ is one that signifies a common substance, as /man/, /horse/. An /Adjective/ noun is one that is applied homonymously  to proper or appellative nouns, and signifies either praise or blame. It is derived from three sources, from the soul, the body, and external things: from the soul, as /sage/, /licentious;/ from the body, as /swift/, /slow;/ from external things, as /rich/, /poor/. A /Relative/ noun is such as /father/, /son/, /friend/, /right/ (hand). A /quasi-Relative/ is such as /night/, /day/, /death/, /life/. A /Homonym/ is a noun predicated homonymously of many things, as of proper nouns, e.g. /Telamonian Aias/, /Oïlean Aias;/ of aplative nouns, as /sea/-mouse, /land/-mouse. A /Synonym/ is a noun which, by several designations, signifies the same thing, as /glaive/, /sword/, /bludgeon/, /blade/, /brand/. A /Pheronym/ is a name given from some accident, as /Tisamenos/ and /Megapenthes/. A /Dionym/ is a couple of names applied to the same proper noun, as Alexander and Paris, without there being any reciprocity in their signification; e.g., if one is Alexander, it does not follow that he is Paris. An /Eponym/ (also called Dionym) is a noun which, along with another proper noun, is applied to one object, as Poseidón is called Enosichthon, and Apollo, Phœbos. A /National/ name is one showing to what nation an individual belongs, as Phrygian, Galatian. An /Interrogative/ (also called an Inquisitive) is so called from being employed in interrogations, as τίς; (who?)—ποῖος; (of what sort?)—πόσος; (how great?)—πηλίκος; (how old?) An /Indefinite/ is a noun placed in opposition to an Interrogative, as ὅστις (whosoever), ὁποῖος (of whatever sort), ὁπόσος (however great), ὁπηλίκος (of whatever age). An /Anaphoric/ noun (called also an Assimilative, a Demonstrative, or an Attributive) is one signifying similarity, as τοιοῦτος (as great), τηλικοῦτος (as old), τοιοῦτος (such). A /Collective/ noun is one which, in the singular number, signifies a multitude, e.g. δῆμος (people), χορός (chorus), ὄχλος (crowd). A /Distributive/ noun is one having a relation to one out of two or more, as ἕτερος (the other), ἑκάτερος (each), ἕκαστος (every one). An /Inclusive/ noun is one that shows what is contained in it, as δαφνών (laurel-grove), παρθενών (virgin's abode).
An /Onomatopoetic/ noun is one formed imitatively from the peculiarities of sounds, as φλοῖσβος (dashing), ῥοῖζος (whistling), ὀρυμαγδός (rattle). A /General/ noun is one that can be divided into a number of species, as /animal/, /plant/. A /Special/ noun is one of those into which a genus is divided, e.g. /ox/, /horse/; /vine/, /olive/. An /Ordinal/ is a noun showing order, as /first/, /second/, /third/. A /Numeral/ is a noun signifying number, as /one/, /two/, /three/. A /Participative/ is a noun partaking of a certain substance, as /golden/, /silvern/. An /Independent/ noun is one which is thought by itself, as /God/, /Reason/.
 The /Dispositions/ of the noun are two. Activity and Passivity; Activity, as /the judge/, /the judging/; Passivity, as /judgeable/, /the judged/.

 # On the Verb (ῥῆμα).
 
A Verb is an indeclinable word, indicating time, person and number, and showing activity or passivity. The verb has eight accidents: Moods, Dispositions (voices!), Species, Forms, Numbers, Tenses, Persons, Conjugations. There are five /Moods/: Indicative, Imperative, Optative, Subjunctive, and Infinitive. There are three /Dispositions/  : Activity, Passivity, and Mediality—Activity, as τύπτω (I strike); Passivity, as τύπτομαι (I am struck); Mediality, marking partly activity and partly passivity, as πέποιθα (I trust), διέφθορα (I waste), ἐποιησάμην (I became), ἐγραψάμην (I registered). There are two /Species:/ Primitive and Derivative—Primitive, as ἄρδω; Derivative, as ἀρδεύω. There are three /Forms:/ Simple, Compound, and Super-Compound—Simple, as φρονῶ; Compound, as καταφρονῶ; Super-Compound, as ἀντιγονίζω (I Antigonize), φιλιππίζω (I Philippize). There are three /Numbers:/ Singular, Dual, and Plural—Singular, as τύπτω; Dual, as τύπτετον Plural, as τύπτομεν. There are three /Persons:/ First, Second, and Third. The First is the person /from/ whom the assertion is; the Second, the one /to/ whom it is; and the Third, the one /concerning/ whom it is. There are three /Tenses:/ Present, Past, Future. Of these, the Past has four sub-species—Imperfect, Perfect, Pluperfect, and Aorist—which stand in three respective relations: the Present is related to the Imperfect, the Perfect to the Pluperfect, and the Aorist to the Future.
 
 # On Conjugation (συζυγία).
 Conjugation is the consecutive inflection of Verbs. Of Barytone Verbs there are six conjugations, of which the First is characterized by β, φ, π, or πτ, as λείβω, γράφω, τέρπω, κόπτω; the Second by γ, κ, χ, or κτ, as λέγω, πλέκω, τρέχω, τίκτω; the Third by δ, θ, or τ, as ᾄδω, πλήθω, ἀνύτω; the Fourth by ζ or σσ, as φράζω, νύσσω, ὀρύσσω; the Fifth by the four unchangeables, λ, μ, ν, ρ, as πάλλω, νέμω; and the Sixth by a pure, as ἱππεύω, πλέω, βασιλεύω, ἀκούω. Some also introduce a Seventh Conjugation, characterized by ξ and ψ, as ἀλέξω, ἕψω.
 
 # On Circumflexed Verbs (περισπώμενα).
 Of Circumflexed Verbs there are three Conjugations, of which the First is characterized in the second and third persons by the diphthong ει, as νοῶ, νοεῖς, νοεῖ; the Second by the diphthong ᾳ, as βοῶ, βοᾷς, βοᾷ (the ι being added in writing,  but not pronounced); and the Third by the diphthong οι, as χρυσῶ, χρυσοῖς, χρυσοῖ.
 
 # On Verbs in μι (τὰ εἰς μι).
 Of Verbs ending in μι there are four conjugations, of which the First is characterized from the first of the Circumflexed Conjugations, as from τιθῶ comes τίθημι; the Second from the second, as from ἱστῶ, ἵστημι; the Third from the third, as from διδῶ, δίδωμι; and the Fourth from the sixth of the Barytone Conjugations, as from πηγνύω, πήγνυμι.
 
 # On the Participle (μετοχή).
 A Participle is a word partaking of the nature both of nouns and verbs.
It has all the accidents which belong to nouns as well as those which belong to verbs, except mood and person.
 
 # On the Article (ἄρθρον).
 An Article is a declinable part of speech prefixed or subjoined to the various cases of nouns, taking, when prefixed, the form ὁ, and, when subjoined, the form ὅς.  . It has three accidents:
Gender, Number, and Case. The /Genders/ are three, as ὁ ποιητής, ἡ ποίησις, τὸ ποίημα. The /Numbers/ are three: Singular, Dual, and Plural—Singular, as ὁ, ἡ, τό; Dual, as τώ, τά; Plural, as οἱ, αἱ, τά.
The /Cases/ are—ὁ, τοῦ, τῷ, τόν, ὦ; ἡ, τῆς, τῇ, τήν, ὦ; τό, τοῦ, τῷ, τό, ὦ.

 # On the Pronoun (ἀντωνυμία .) 
A Pronoun is a word assumed instead of a noun, and indicating definite persons. It has six accidents: Person, Gender, Number, Case, Form, and Species.

 # On Primitive Pronouns.
The /Persons/ of the Primitive Pronouns are ἐνώ , σύ, ἴ; those of the Derivative Pronouns, ἐμός, σός, ὅς. The /Genders/ of the Primitive Pronouns are not expressed in speech, but by the indication which they make, as ἐγώ (I), whereas the Genders of the Derivatives are expressed in speech, as ὁ ἐμός, ἡ ἐμή, τὸ ἐμόν. The /Numbers/ of the Primitives are—Singular, ἐγώ, σύ, ἴ; Dual, νῶϊ, σφῶϊ; Plural, ἡμεῖς, ὑμεῖς, σφεῖς:
those of the Derivatives—Singular, ἐμός, σός, ὅς; Dual, ἐμώ, σώ, ὥ; Plural, ἐμοί, σοί, οἵ. The /Cases/ of the Primitives are—Direct, ἐγώ, σύ, ἴ; Generic, ἐμοῦ, σοῦ, οὗ; Dative, ἐμοί, σοί, οἷ; Accusative, ἐμέ, σέ, ἕ; Vocative, σύ: those of the Derivatives are ἐμός, σός, ὅς; ἐμοῦ, σοῦ, οὗ; ἐμῷ, σῷ, ᾧ· ἐμόν, σόν, ὅν. There are two /Forms:/ Simple and Compound—Simple, ἐμοῦ, σοῦ, οὗ; Compound, ἐμαυτοῦ, σαυτοῦ, ἑαυτοῦ. There are two /Species/, inasmuch as some are Primitive, as ἐγώ, σύ, ἴ, and others Derivative, as are all the Possessives, which are also called Bi-personals. They are thus derived—from Singulars, those designating one possessor, as ἐμοῦ, ἐμός; from Duals, those designating two, as from νῶϊ, νωίτερος; from Plurals, those designating many, as from ἡμεῖς, ἡμέτερος. Of the Pronouns, some are [used] without the article and some with it—without the article, as ἐγώ; with the article, as ὁ ἐμός.

 # On Prepositions (πρόθεσις). 
 A Preposition is a word placed before any of the parts of speech, both in Composition and in Syntax. The number of Prepositions is eighteen, whereof six are monosyllabic, ἐν , εἰς , ἔξ , πρό , πρός , σύν —which are incapable of anastrophé—and twelve are dissyllabic, ἀνά, κατά, διά, μετά, παρά, ἀντί, ἐπί, περί, ἀμφί, ἀπό, ὑπό, ὑπέρ.

 An Adverb is an indeclinable part of speech, said of a verb or added to a verb. Of the Adverbs, some are Simple, and others Compound—Simple, as πάλαι; Compound, as πρόπαλαι. Some are indicative of time, as νῦν, τότε, αὖθις: to these we must subordinate as species those that connote particular times or seasons, as σήμερον, αὔριον, τόφρα, τέως, πηνίκα.

 A Conjunction is a word binding together a thought in order and filling up the hiatuses of speech. Of conjunctions, some are copulative, some disjunctive, some conjunctive, some præter-conjunctive, some causative, some dubitative, some conclusive, and some expletive. /Copulative/ Conjunctions are those which bind together a discourse which flows on indefinitely: they are these, μέν, δέ, τέ, καί, ἀλλά, ἠμέν, ἠδέ, ἀτάρ, αὐτάρ, ἤτοι. /Disjunctive/ Conjunctions are those which bind the phrase more firmly together, and disjoin the facts expressed: they are these, ἤ, ἤτοι, ἠέ. /Conjunctive/ Conjunctions are those which do not indicate any actual existence, but signify sequence: they are these, εἰ, εἴπερ, εἰδή, εἰδήπερ. The /Præter-conjunctives/ are those which, along with actual existence, show also order: they are these, ἐπεί, ἐπείπερ, ἐπειδή, ἐπειδήπερ . /Causatives/ are those which are taken to express cause: they are these, ἵνα , ὄφρα , ὅπως , ἕνεκα , οὕνεκα , ὅτι , διό , διότι , καθό , καθότι , καθόσον . /Dubitatives/ are those which we are wont to use when we are in doubt; they are these, ἆρα , κἆτα , μῶν . /Inferentials/ are those which lend themselves readily to conclusions and summings-up of demonstrations: they are these, ἄρα , ἀλλά , ἀλλὰ μέν , τοίνυν , τοιγάρτοι , τοιγαροῦν. /Expletives/ are those which are used for the sake of metre or ornament: they are these, δή , ῥά , νύ , ποῦ , τοί , θήν , ἄρ , δῆτα , πέρ , πώ , μήν , ἄν , αὖ , οὖν , κέν , γέ .
